# Chug

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

Chug is an unconventional symmetric cipher in which the ciphertext is used to map a message into a key value that defines how the ciphertext can be read in order to reveal the plaintext message. The only requirement of the cipher is that the size of the ciphertext be equal to or larger than the size of the plaintext. Chug very closely resembles the [One-time pad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_pad) encryption technique, but differs in mathematic operation and in the use of the key.
